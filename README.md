# wallace_tree
Wallace tree multiplier is a tree based multiplication algorithm .
wallace tree multiplier  contain different circuit components like half adder ,full adder , 4:2 compressor .
before designing the multiplier all this half adder , full adder and compressor are realized using the reversible logic gates .
reversible logic gates are peres gate ,cnot gate, bjn gate,fredkin gates etc .
Advantage of reversible logic gates over  conventional gates is  having the property of reversibilty .
reversibilty property means we can find the inputs throw the generated outputs.
